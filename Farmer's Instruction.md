# Welcome, new farmer!

## Creating a field

Enter the dimensions you would like your new field to have. Dimensions are measured in sheep, naturally. You will be prevented from adding too many sheep as to comply with DEFRA guidelines.

## Adding a sheep

Enter a name for your new sheep and select its gender, then click the 'Add sheep' button.

## Selecting sheep

Click on a sheep! Your primary selection will gain a blue outline. Clicking another sheep in the same field will set your secondary selection, denoted by its red outline. Undo your last selection by clicking the same sheep, or deselect both by clicking any sheep other than the last one selected.

## Branding and releasing sheep

Once you have only your primary sheep selected, you have the option to brand or release them by clicking the respective buttons. Branding will prevent that sheep from being able to reproduce. Releasing them will set them free to roam and live their best sheep life.

## Breeding sheep

Once two sheep have been selected, they can be bred by clicking the 'Breed sheep' button! Alternatively, two random sheep within a selected field can be selected at random to mate by clicking the 'Breed random sheep' button, but the pairings will naturally be a slight less predictable.
